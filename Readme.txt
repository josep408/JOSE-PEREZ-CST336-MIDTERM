Question 1: 

A.) there are three possible ways to implement css into an HTML page 
1: inline: by using the style attribute in HTML elements 
2:Internal: by using the <style> element inthe <head> 
3: External: by using an external css file for all of the modifications.

the precednce order is: inline first because it is more direct and esepcific, then internal because it is in the head of the document and is somewaht direct, and lastly external since it has to be imported from a source using the <link> tag


B.) Margin is the space between the border and the next element of the design. while Padding is the space inside any given element, between the element and the borders.
